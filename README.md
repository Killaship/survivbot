# survivbot

# This bot is now deprecated. It's been entirely rewritten by DamienVesper, you can now find it at https://github.com/DamienVesper/SurvivReloadedBot.

The source code for the Discord bot I made for the Surviv Reloaded Discord server.
To run the bot, it's recommended to have the following materials:
- 1 computer (preferably running a Unix-like OS,) capable of running discord.py and Python 3, as well as various standard libraries.
- 1 cranial space filled with cerebrospinal fluid and grey matter.
- Access to the program tmux on aforementioned computer, as a shell compatible with bash scripts.
Run `runbot.sh` to run the bot. It should automatically bring the bot back up if it crashes, so make sure to hit ^C twice when stopping the bot, or killing the runbot process before stopping the bot, to prevent the bot from being restarted.

Just as a note: This bot is made in Python, sorta sucks, and my code is not that great, and there's some quite insecure bits.  Not for use in a professional environment. In fact, this bot is custom made for a server I mod in, why would you?
